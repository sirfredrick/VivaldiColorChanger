# How to Contribute
A healthy contributing environment helps keep this project running. We love and appreciate input from the community of how to make Vivaldi Color Changer better. Here are some guidelines to keep everything organized.

## Getting Started
- Make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account so you can participate.
- It would be very helpful if you have a compatible testing machine (Windows Computer with a [RGB Fusion motherboard](https://www.gigabyte.com/mb/rgb/) and [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) installed) so that you can see if there are any issues. If you don't I will test your pull requests before they are merged to see if they work properly.
- If you are not working on one of the `Planned Features` then please submit an issue so that we are all on the same page about the project.
- Fork this repository and begin coding!

## Making Changes
- Please make a separate branch for your issue if there is not one already. Avoid working on master (even I forget this sometimes).
- Make commits of logical size that relate to fix one small issue.

## Code Formatting
-  Always make sure to format your code with ctr+k and ctr+d command and the default Visual Studio 2017 settings.
-  Projects, namespaces, and Classes are `PascalCase`.
- Methods and variables are `camelCase`.

## Submitting Changes
- Push your changes to your fork's separate aka non-master branch.
- Submit a pull request to the main VivaldiColorChanger repository. 
- You will receive feedback on your pull request. You may be required to make changes before the request is merged.

Thanks for your contribution(s)!
